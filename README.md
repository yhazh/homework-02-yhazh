# Homework 02

This homework contains three tasks 

## Task 01

Write a program that calculates the average annual temperature.
Also, you need to find months with the lowest and the highest temperature in a year.

Month          |  I   | II   | III |  IV  |  V   |  VI  | VII  | VIII | IX   |  X   | XI  | XII 
---------------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|------
Temperature    | -1.7 | -1,0 | 2,6 |  9,0 | 15,1 | 19,4 | 21,4 | 21,2 | 17,1 | 11,1 | 5,9 |  1,4    

The example below shows how your output might look:

```text
Average annual temperature: 10.125
Month with the lowest temperature in a year: I
The month with the highest temperatures in a year: VII
```
   
## Task 02

Write a program that displays a table of temperature correspondence in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit (F°=9/5·C° + 32).
The user should input the temperature range in degrees Celsius and the step. 

The example below shows how your output might look. The symbol >>> represents the user input. 
Notice that it's not the part of the input.

```text   
t1 >>> 0
t2 >>> 10
dt >>> 1
-----------------
C       F
-----------------
0.00    32.00
1.00    33.80
2.00    35.60
3.00    37.40
4.00    39.20
5.00    41.00
6.00    42.80
7.00    44.60
8.00    46.40
9.00    48.20
10.00   50.00
-----------------
```

## Task 03

Write a program that determines the minimum of a sequence positive numbers (the length of the sequence is not limited).
 
The user should input the numbers until enter a zero or negative number.

The example below shows how your output might look. The symbol >>> represents the user input. 
Notice that it's not the part of the input.
   
```text
Enter the number after symbol >>>. To exit enter a zero.
>>> 12
>>> 75
>>> 10
>>> 9
>>> 23
>>> 0
Minimum number is 9
```
